## ‚ú® Features

### üç¥ Food, Drink & Stew
- Configurable consumable categories:
  - `Eat` ‚Üí food items (e.g., bread, steak)
  - `Drink` ‚Üí drinks (e.g., water, whiskey, coffee)
  - `Stew` ‚Üí soups and stews (uses bowl animation)
- Each item can modify multiple needs:
  - Hunger, Thirst, Stress, Alcohol, Poison, PoisonRate
- Items automatically become **usable** via `RSGCore.Functions.CreateUseableItem()`.

### üç∫ Alcohol System
- Each alcoholic item increases the player‚Äôs alcohol level.  
- At high levels, players experience:
  - Motion blur and camera shake
  - Drunken movement effects
- Alcohol level decays over time (`Config.AlcoholDecayRate`).

### ‚ò†Ô∏è Poison & Stress
- Poison gradually damages the player's health over time.  
- Certain foods/drinks can reduce stress.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Advanced Health Recovery System
- **Smart Combat Detection**: Automatically pauses health regeneration during combat
- **Balanced Regeneration**: Realistic health recovery rates (0.15% per 20 seconds)
- **Damage Cooldown**: 45-second cooldown after taking damage before regeneration starts
- **Combat Timeout**: 15 seconds of no damage to exit combat state
- **Resting Bonus**: Slightly faster regeneration when not moving (1.3x multiplier)
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with rsg-medic and rex_zombies systems

### üçñüç∫ Automatic Needs System (NEW!)
- **Auto Decrease**: Hunger and thirst automatically decrease over time
- **Activity-Based**: Different decrease rates based on player activity:
  - Idle: Normal rate
  - Walking: 20% faster decrease
  - Running: 50% faster decrease
  - Sprinting: 100% faster decrease
  - Swimming: 150% faster decrease
- **Smart Notifications**: Warnings when hunger/thirst are low or critical
- **Health Damage**: Critical needs cause health damage over time
- **Configurable**: Fully customizable decrease rates and thresholds  

### üé¨ Immersive Animations
Each consumption type has its own prop and animation:
| Type | Animation | Example Prop |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Eat | ‚Äúeat_food‚Äù | bread, meat |
| Drink | ‚Äúdrink_bottle‚Äù | bottle, mug |
| Stew | ‚Äúeat_stew‚Äù | bowl |
| HotDrink | ‚Äúdrink_cup‚Äù | coffee cup |

Animations sync between client and nearby players for full immersion.
