## Migration Guide

### For Server Owners
1. **Backup your current config.lua** before updating
2. **Review new configuration options** in the updated config.lua
3. **Test the new system** with `/healthdebug` and `/healthstatus` commands
4. **Adjust settings** if needed for your server's balance

### Configuration Changes
The new system adds these configuration options:
```lua
CombatDetection = {
    Enabled = true,
    DamageCooldown = 45000,
    CombatTimeout = 15000,
    MinDamageToTrigger = 8,
}
```

### Breaking Changes
- Health regeneration is now significantly slower and more realistic
- Combat detection may affect players who were used to fast regeneration
- Some configuration values have changed (see "Changed" section above)
